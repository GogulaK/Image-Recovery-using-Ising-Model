## Introduction
In this project we implement a hopfield network to recover original images from a set of corrupted images.
Given a set of binary images, our goal is to:
* Learn the parameters using a set of training images.
* Predict the most likely assignment of pixel values for the corrupted versions of training images using ICM.

## Parameter Learning
1. Hebbian Learning Rule
2. Maximum Pseudo Likelihood

This project is completed as part of CS5340- Uncertainty Modelling in AI (Probabilistic Graphical Models) coursework.
